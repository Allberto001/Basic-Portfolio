    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/image1.jpg" alt="an image of a aurora">

<p>Hello there and welcome to my "about me" page that I created myself, in here you'll find every reason
why I would be an asset to you. Im your usual persistent everyday person who hates leaving things undone, 
I cannot leave a task until I feel satisfied with the results and well im just simply stubborn on reaching as close
as possible to perfection with my work. Hopefully that's the type of guy your looking for in your work place.</p>

<p>I went a little straight to the point with my last paragraph but I always prefer to cut to the chase.
 The type fo job experiences that I had in my past can most likely benefit you in your company as well. 
 I've been a manager for a small smoothie joint called Boba at Avetura Mall in aventura Fl for about 3 years
 I would say and I can say that it has given me some leadership skills, managing people is never an easy task.
 That job gave me a strong sense of responsibility seeing that I was the only one running that place, I needed to make 
 sure we always had what we needed and keep the business running. I also obtained another job at Metro PCS
 as a sales rep, that job was the easiest job I ever had but it's where my love for phones and tech in general 
 was born. We would have early hands on tech before it got released to the public and had early trainig on
 on all these new phones before we got to sell them so we knew what features to highlight in order bring about 
 the customers appeal towards that product. During that job I started school at Miami Dade College in miami Fl in the field of Electronics Engineering  
which was a variety of things to coding, computer science, understanding schematics, microprocessor, analog
and digital communications and more. I must admit it was a tuff degree to acheive but I earned it in May of 2018
, during my attendance to school I had switch to another job and starting working for Comcast as another sales rep.
This job was a bit challenging at first because customers usually came to the office to fight about their bills and services
but eventually I got that hang of it. In this I really had to learn how to be a good problem solver and be 
a smooth talker while I was it too, the job really forced me to be social and adapt to the several personalities
according to the situation, basically it taught me how to relate, explore, and execute my idea and plan with others.
I had to really sell myself in that job and with time I knew how to sway emotions and attention to the product I wanted
the customer to purchase. Im currenlty still in this job and been here for five years as of the making of this page.
</p>

<p>Hopefully that was more detailed for you than that first paragraph, right now im working on my certification on 
becoming a fully-stacked developer in the University of Miami. In my contact page you can reach me and in my 
portfolio page you can explore all the projects that I was able to create while earning my certification.
